A Disc Golf weather app that uses Gooogle maps API and Darkskys Weather API.
On the map are hard coded marked locations of disc golf courses. If you click on one of 
the markers it will do an API call to DarkSkys API and pull the weather for that courses location.

The wheather is broken up into three categories first is Curent weather, Hourly Weather, and Daily weather.

The frontend is written in React.js while the backend utilizes a MongoDB & Express.

The backend was put into place for login ability and further development.
